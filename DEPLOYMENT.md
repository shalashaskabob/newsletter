## Option 3: Vercel (Frontend) + Railway (Backend)

### Frontend (Vercel):
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repo
3. Vercel auto-deploys the React app

### Backend (Railway):
1. Create a separate repo with just the `server/` folder
2. Deploy on Railway as above
3. Update your React app's API calls to point to the Railway backend URL

## Environment Variables

For production, you may want to set:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=3000` (or whatever your host provides)

---

## Local Testing Before Deployment

```bash
# Build the production version
npm run build

# Test the production build locally
npm run build-and-serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:3002` to test the production build.

## Troubleshooting

### Puppeteer Issues on Render/Railway:
If you get Puppeteer errors, the hosting platform will automatically install the required dependencies. Both Render and Railway support Puppeteer out of the box.

### CORS Issues:
The app is configured to work in production. If you encounter CORS issues, make sure your frontend is making requests to the correct backend URL.

### Build Failures:
Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json` and not just `devDependencies` if they're needed for the build.
